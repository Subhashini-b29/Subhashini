WEED DETECTION USING MACHINE VISION
This project is used to identity weeds among crops. Here in agricultural land the weed gets growth in between of crops,
it reduces the crop growing strength. If we remove the weed by humans it consumes the man power and cost,
so we go with this technical work by reducing the man power , cost and weeds in farmlands.
 The image is captured and processed using machine vision technology and the image is converted into,
1)HSV image
2) Segmented image
3)Gray image
The final gray image is the binary output which is used to identity whether the given image is crop or weed. 
The weed get destroyed by spraying pesticide.
